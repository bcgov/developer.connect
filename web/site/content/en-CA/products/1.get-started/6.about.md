4. [How do I authorize the BC Registries API key in order to use it?]{.font-semibold}

   You can authorize the API key that BC Registries provided to you by using your ServiceBC Connect account number that the API key was issued for. Click on Authorize on the specific registry (eg. Registry Search API or Personal Property Registry APIs).

<!-- 5. [I need to test my search queries, how do I do that?]{.font-semibold}

   First, ensure you have a Sandbox API key for your specific account. For Registry Search API, you will need to populate the sandbox environment by making a Business Registry submission of test business data through the Business Registry API first. Then, you can use your search API query to pull the test data created.
