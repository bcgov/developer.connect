# BC Registries APIs

The BC Registries APIs are HTTP-based RESTful APIs. Request and response
bodies are formatted in JSON. The API specifications are written in
OpenAPI (OAS) version 3.x.

## API Common Information

The information below applies to all BC Registries APIs.

### Environments

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Environment</th>
    <th>Base URL</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>MOCK</td>
    <td>https://bcregistry-bcregistry-mock.apigee.net</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SANDBOX</td>
    <td>https://bcregistry-sandbox.apigee.net</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>PRODUCTION</td>
    <td>https://bcregistry-prod.apigee.net</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The Mock environment requires an API key, does not charge a fee, and only works with the example requests defined in the API specifications.

---

### Status and Error Responses

The APIs use HTTP Status Codes to indicate success or failure. The table below lists the common status codes.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Status Code</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>200</td>
    <td>Successful request and response.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>201</td>
    <td>Successfully created.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>400</td>
    <td>
      Bad Request. The server cannot or will not process the request due to
      an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too
      large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>401</td>
    <td>
      Unauthorized. Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when
      authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been
      provided. The user does not have valid authentication credentials for
      the target resource.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>404</td>
    <td>
      Not Found. The requested resource could not be found but may be
      available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are
      permissible.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>422</td>
    <td>
      Unprocessable Entity. The request was well-formed but was unable to be
      followed due to semantic errors. Most likely the value of a data
      element such as a code is invalid.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>500</td>
    <td>
      Internal Server Error. A generic error message, given when an
      unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is
      suitable.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>503</td>
    <td>
      Service Unavailable. The server cannot handle the request (because it 
      is overloaded or down for maintenance). Response when an API is 
      temporarily unavailable as part of a scheduled release.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

A 400 or 500 level status code will include a an error response containing
an errorMessage and an optional rootCause. Below is an example of a BC Registries
API gateway error: a 401 Unauthorized response body when submitting a request with an invalid API key:

```
  {
    "errorMessage": "API security error: API key check failed.",
    "rootCause": "{\"fault\":{\"faultstring\":\"Invalid ApiKey\",\"detail\":{\"errorcode\":\"oauth.v2.InvalidApiKey\"}}}"
  }
```

Here is a 400 Bad Request response body example when submitting a payment API invalid fee code request:

```
  {
    "errorMessage": "API backend third party service error.",
    "rootCause": "{\"detail\": \"Invalid Corp Type or Filing Type.\", \"title\": \"Invalid Request\", \"type\": \"INVALID_CORP_OR_FILING_TYPE\"}"
  }
```

### How Security Works

On successful completion of an API access request you will be issued a gateway API key that is globally unique and tied to your security account. As part of the access request you specify which APIs you want to use. Gateway authentication requires that your API key is included with each request, and that the API key has permission to accesss the API that the request is for. More granular Registries authorization is managed by the security role(s) associated with your BC OnLine account Id, which is linked to both your security account and your API key.

As part of the access request you will receive instructions on maintaining your API key: how to request a new one and how to replace an existing one for an API gateway environment.

---

### How Payment Works

Your BC OnLine Account has a payment method associated with it. Your API key is
linked to your BC OnLine Account ID. When an API request for which there is a
service fee is submitted with your API key and your BC OnLine Account ID, a
charge is applied to your acount using the payment method you set up. The API
response body includes a payment invoice identifier and a relative path to the payment
receipt. For example:

```
  "payment": {
    "receipt": "/api/v1/payment-requests/2198743/receipts",
    "invoiceId": "2198743"
  }
```

The invoiceId is the BC Registries payment record identifier. The receipt is a
corresponding relative path to the BC Registries Payment API to retrieve
payment receipt information for your API transaction.

### Analytics Reports

BC OnLine Account consumer API Gateway activity is tracked for up to 30 days in
the past. Daily and weekly reports are available in JSON or CSV formats. Basic
metrics available in these reports include:

- response status
- response time
- API name
- traffic
- errors

Once you have received the daily or weekly report data, you can import that data
into your own data visualization tools or analytics system.

### Message Logging

BC Online Account consumer API Gateway message logging is available by account
ID and Gateway API. A dedicated message log archive is created for an account ID
and API combination. It requires a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account and
project configured with permission to view the account message log. Message log
entries include the following properties:

- request timestamp
- request method
- request path
- response status code
- request payload
- response payload

### API Release Management

#### Major Version Releases

The BC Registries APIs follow <a href="https://semver.org/" target="_blank">Semantic Versioning</a>.
Major versions of an API may be released in March or September. The exception is an initial release, which has no such restriction.
A new version is defined as an increment in the "vx" value of an API base path, where "x" is the version number. The initial version is "v1".

- Up to 2 major versions are concurrently supported, meaning that when version 3 is released version 1 will no longer be available.
- A major release may include:
  - The removal of an existing endpoint.
  - A change to a schema definition for an existing endpoint.
  - Cumulative enhancements or fixes for one or more existing endpoints.
- An API release may be skipped in a given release window if there are no changes within the previous 6 months.
- A major version release will be available in the SANDBOX environment at least 1 month prior to the release date.

#### Minor Releases

Minor Releases may occur outside the major version release schedule. A minor release will not include:

- A change to an existing API endpoint definition.
- A change to an existing API schema definitions.

A minor release may include a significant enhancement, such as:

- Adding a new endpoint.
- Adding a new schema definition as part of adding a new endpoint.
- Addding a new type to an existing endpoint, such as a new Financing Statement registration type.

A minor version release will be available in the SANDBOX environment at least 1 month prior to the PRODUCTION release.

#### Patch Releases

Outside of the above major version release schedule, minor fixes to an existing version of an API may be published as a patch release if:

- No change is made to the API endpoint definitions.
- No change is made to the API schema definitions.

For example, changing the validation rules for a Financing Statement registration type may be a candidate for a patch release.

Changes included in a patch release are described in the API's "API Version History" section.

When possible, a patch release will be available in the SANDBOX environment at least 1 week prior to the PRODUCTION release.
