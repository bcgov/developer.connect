      summary: Submit a new search request
      description: '<p>Executes a new search query as the first of two steps in the search process. The results are a summary list of one or more matches that after review can be filtered as the second step in the search process. The second step returns MH Registration details. If the search has no matches, the HTTP response code is 201, there are no match results in the response, and totalResultsSize is 0. A service fee is charged for each new search query selection (step 2). The four types of searches are:<ul><li>MHR_NUMBER - Search by MANUFACTURED HOME REGISTRATION Number (exact match)</li><li>OWNER_NAME - Search by owner name</li><li>ORGANIZATION_NAME - Search by organization/business name</li><li>SERIAL_NUMBER - Search by serial number</li></ul></p><p>Results are sorted in acending order chronologically by registration createDateTime.</p><p>Note<br>BC Registries may impose an upper limit on the total number of results returned (TBD). The response includes <ul><li>returnedResultsSize - the number of results returned.</li><li>totalResultsSize - the number of matches found in the Registry.</li><li>maxResultsSize - the Registry upper limit on number of results returned.</li></ul><br>If totalResultsSize is greater than returnedResultsSize then you need to refine your search criteria such as with start and end timestamps to include the omitted matches.</p>'
