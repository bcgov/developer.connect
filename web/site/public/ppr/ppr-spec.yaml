      summary: Select Search Financing Statements
      description: '<p>As the second step in the search two-step process, choose from the summary information returned in the first step which Financing Statements to retrieve detailed information about. Only matchType and baseRegistrationNumber need to be provided to select a Financing Statement. The detail information includes all Change Statement, Amendment Statement, Renewal, and Discharge Statement information in reverse chronological order (most recent first). Exact match Financing Statements are automatically included in the results. If the request "selected" property is either absent or set to true the associated Financing Statement is included in the response.</p><p>If requesting a PDF and the number of Financing Statements is greater than 75, the request must include a callbackURL parameter, otherwise a 400 status is returned. If the request is accepted in this scenario the response will return a getReportURL value. When the report is available a notification will be sent to the callbackURL. The body of the notification is a single JSON property getReportURL with the same value as the original response. The caller can then use the GET /ppr/api/v1/search-results/{searchId} endpoint to fetch the PDF.</p><p>As of version 1.2.5, a callback URL will be used in a search results report request if it is submitted and the response JSON is over 220KB in size, which corresponds to a report of approximatedly 150 pages or more.</p><p>Only include a callbackURL in the request if one of the above conditions is true.</p><p><b>NOTE: </b> if the request header Accept value is application/pdf a report is returned in the response only if the immediate report generation is successful. If the report service fails to generate a report but the request is otherwise successful, a status code of 202 - Accepted is returned and the repsonse payload is JSON. A subsequent GET is required to obtain the report.</p>'
